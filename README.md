# Module1_Project
This project is in two parts. There is a game _Classic Snake_, then there is a webapp, _Flashy Flash Cards_ thats allows you to create flash cards for studying via interaction with a chatbot.

## Motivation
The motivation of this project was to learn how to manipulate the DOM using Javacript to create functional and interactive web applications. 
The flash cards web app was inspired by a lack of similar applicaitons being available out there on the market. It also allowed me to get practice creating a bot
that utilizes very basic Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Build Status - Improvements to come...
Currently both the game and the webapp are functional. Though there are features I will be adding in later.
**Classic Snake**: 
[] Add difficulty settings that can be choosen with different high scores being saved for the different levels
**Flashy Flash Cards:** 
[]Improve the chat bot's NLP ability. 
[]Improve the functionality of the chatbot, allowing users to ask for specific cards to be changed. 

## Code Style
The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all standard modern notation and syntax. The VS Code extention _Prettier Code_-<https://prettier.io/> was used for formating.
